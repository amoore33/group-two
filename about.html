    <h1>What is GFY News?</h1>
    <p>We&rsquo;re real people, just like you. We promi<span class="secret">s</span>e.</p>
    <p>We give you what <em>really</em> matters.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re <em>definitely</em> not just <span class="secret">p</span>ulling things out of our ass half the time.</p>
    <h2>Our Founding</h2>
    <p>According to myth, <span class="secret">a</span> drunk guy in an alleyway found a broken <span class="secret">M</span>acbook and said, &ldquo;You know what would be <em>really</em> funny?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>And ever since, we&rsquo;ve been <span class="secret">t</span>rying to live up to his increasingly esoteric and ill-defined g<span class="secret">o</span>als. Seriously, Mike, ca<span class="secret">n</span> you stay sober enough for <em>two minutes</em> to draw up a flowchart?</p>
    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
    <p>Our primary <span class="secret">g</span>oal is to give you storie<span class="secret">s</span> that will make you feel confused, frightened, <span class="secret">p</span>leasantly surprised, <span class="secret">a</span>nd/or hopefully some co<span class="secret">m</span>bination thereof.</p>
    <p>â€¦ Wha<span class="secret">t</span>? Secondary goals? Only <em>c<span class="secret">o</span>wards</em> would have such thi<span class="secret">n</span>gs.</p>
